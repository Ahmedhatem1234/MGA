# MGA
first we made the origin at the center of the stomach then we made the arms and legs and we put the axis of them in the right place.
we made switch cases for the keyboard buttons to control the camera and object and we made constant for each switch case.
we made perspective function , and we put constant vog so when we choose z we made zoomin and zoom out.
thank you
